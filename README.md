# Real-Engine-Analysis
MATLAB-based Real Engine Analysis GUI developed for propulsion studies. The tool analyzes real turbojet and turbofan cycles considering component efficiencies and non-ideal conditions. It calculates thrust, SFC, and efficiencies via an interactive interface. Available as open-source code and standalone installer.

# 📌 Overview

This project is a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed for real air-breathing engine performance analysis. The tool allows users to analyze turbojet and turbofan engine cycles under realistic conditions by including component efficiencies and non-ideal effects. The main purpose of this project is to make propulsion cycle analysis more interactive and easier to understand for aerospace engineering students.

# 🚀 Features
